## About the Frontend (WIP)
This fronted is built based on [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
The UI base components were used from [Material UI](https://mui.com/).
For data fetching and state management it was used [axios](https://axios-http.com/) and [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) (with addition of some Redux-React plugins).
